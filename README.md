**<span style="color:teal">Introduction</span>**
--
This program permits the automated generation of affinity ladders from `quantitative Yeast Two Hybrid` experiments. The program requires flow cytometry data `.fcs` files (linear scale). It generates a `.csv` table file that contains for each sample the mean reporter level. The actual affinity ladder graph is reported into a `.pdf` file.

*<span style="color:teal">1 Recommendation for acquisition</span>*
-
Our program requires `linear` values for all fluorescence channels. Thus, be vigilant that your acquisition program is saving data as linear (even if your acquisition display is `log` or `hyper log`).

Yeast cells are usually smaller than the focused laser beam (spot) of flow cytometers. The maximum signal (= Height, H) for a given cell is obtained when the cell is fully covered by the laser spot. Thus, `H` reflects the total cellular content of the fluorophore. Therefore, we recommend to use the signal `Height (H)` of each channel.

Moreover, some flow-cytometers can apply internal corrections on specific channels. For example, the MacsquantVYB (that we used for our experiment) is correcting the `Area A` of each channels:
>Area is the sum of a defined number of adjacent samples at the trigger time point divided by a scaling factor. This factor is chosen in a way that for "normal" events H=A to obtain a diagonal. The scaling factor is pressure dependent.

Thus we strongly recommend to use as much as possible **non-manipulated** values.  

*<span style="color:teal">2 Main Menu</span>*
-
To start the program you need to execute the `Analysis_QY2H.py` python script:

```bash
$ python Analysis_QY2H.py
```

The main menu will propose you different functions:
1. **Configure channels** To select the channels to be used for the analysis.
2. **Start analysis** To generate a `quantitative Yeast Two Hybrid` affinity ladder from a set of `.fcs` files.
3. **Abort** To exit the program.


![Main Menu](/doc/Main_Menu.jpg)

*<span style="color:teal">3 Configure the names of the channels</span>*
-

Before performing your first analysis, it is recommended to configure your channels. If you keep always the same acquisition settings, this step is required only once.

When clicking on `Configure channels`, the program prompts you to choose a `.fcs` file.

![Select File](/doc/Select_File.jpg)

The program will identify all channels recorded in your file. You can then attribute the correct names in the various columns. For the subsequent analysis, the column `BFP` corresponds to the `Reporter` you want to quantify. The `RFP` and the `GFP` columns correspond to the `BD-Bait` and `AD-Prey` fusion proteins respectively.

The first two columns are not used yet, but might be included in a future development of this program to sub-select a population of cells with uniform `FSC` and/or `SSC`.

The select channel names will be saved in the `channels.config` file (in the `utils` folder) when clicking on `VALIDATE`.


![Select Channels](/doc/Select_Channels.jpg)


*<span style="color:teal">4 Perform an analysis</span>*
-
When clicking on `Start analysis`, the program displays the analysis configuration window. You need first to select the folder where all your files (from the same experiment) are stored.

The program will automatically find all `.fcs` files present in this folder and display them in the analysis settings interface.

![Input](/doc/Select_Input.jpg)

You need then to specific in which folder you want the output files to be generated. By default, the program is set on the input folder.

![Output](/doc/Select_Output.jpg)

Once the path of the `ÃŒNPUT` and `OUTPUT` folders are set, you have access to the analysis settings. The program will generate the `Affinity ladder` by taking a sub-ensemble of cells using gates in the `AD-Prey GFP` and `BD-Bait RFP` channels. By default the minimal and maximal values are set to those of the Fig. 4 (B and C) of our publication.

![Configuration](/doc/Analysis_Configuration.jpg)

The maximum in the `Reporter (BFP)` channel, corresponds to the upper-limit (x axis) of the generated `Cumulative mean` for each sample. If the curves in the `.pdf` output file are not reaching a plateau, increase this value.

The value `BFP bins` corresponds to the number of points you want to be displayed on the final graph.

You can remove the background of the system by selecting `Remove negative Control`. Unchecking this option is useful to monitor the contribution of the background in your experiment. This information is helpful especially for the weakest interactors.

![Controls](/doc/Select_Controls.jpg)

You need to specify which sample file corresponds to your `negative` control, even if no background subtraction is applied. Typically, the negative control corresponds to a qY2H experiment performed with fluorescent empty BD-Bait and AD-Prey fusion proteins. In our work, this control is called 0-0.fcs.

The value `Number of cells` corresponds to the maximum number of cells to be loaded from your file before doing the dual gating in the `AD-Prey GFP` and `BD-Bait RFP` channels. **We highly recommend you to analyse at least 1 000 000 events to obtain a reliable affinity ladder.**

You have the possibility to display the `Cumulative mean` in log or linear scale.

When clicking `START`, the program proceeds to the analysis (only if a negative control has been specified).

![Progress](/doc/Analysis_Progress.jpg)

During the analysis the two `Progress Bars` inform you which file (first bar) is currently processed, and which analysis step (second bar) is performed.

Finally, the program displays the result of the analysis, with the main settings in the title. Here we present the result with the following activated options:
- **Remove negative Control**
- **Y axis in log scale**

![Results](/doc/Results.jpg)

Click on `ABORT` to exit the program.

*<span style="color:teal">5 Output files</span>*
-
The program generates two files. The `.csv` table contains the `mean BFP` value for each sample file (after subtraction of the negative control, if selected), and the `.pdf` report file encloses the qY2H affinity ladder graph. This two files have a common unique prefix based on the date and time of analysis.
